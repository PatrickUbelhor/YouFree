HackIlliois 2019 project

Built an android, web and discord app to help users plan to meet with friends, using a PostgreSQL server.

Users can fill theirs schedules through the application, and other users can see when they are next available to meet.

The Android app was built with both Java and Kotlin, and implemented the REST Api using OKHttp3, Gson, and org.json.

The web app part of the project was created using Angular 6 and programmed in TypeScript. It implemented many modules available in the Angular CLI and Angular Material Libraries.

The server is implemented in Java with the Spring Boot framework to configure the endpoints and interface with the PostreSQL database.

The Discord bot interfaces with the discord API to allow users to gain access to their friend's schedule to see who is available on their server. project
