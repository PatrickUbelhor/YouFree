HackIlliois 2019 project

Built an android, web and discord app to help users plan to meet with friends.

Users can fill their schedules through the application, and other users can see when they are next available to meet.

The Android app was built with both Java and Kotlin, and consumes the REST API using OKHttp3, Gson, and org.json.

The web app was created using Angular 6 and programmed in TypeScript. It implemented many modules available in the Angular CLI and Angular Material Libraries.

The server is implemented in Java with the Spring Boot framework to configure the endpoints and interface with the PostreSQL database.

The Discord bot interfaces with the Discord API to allow users to gain access to their friends' schedules to see who is available on their Discord server.
