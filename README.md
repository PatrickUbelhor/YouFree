HackIlliois 2020 project

Built an android and web app to help users plan to meet with friends.

Users can fill theirs schedules through the application, and other users can see when they are next available to meet.

The Android app was built with both Java and Kotlin, and implemented the REST Api using OKHttp3, Gson, and org.json.

The web app was created using React JS.

The server is implemented in Java with the Spring Boot framework to configure the endpoints and interface with the PostreSQL database.
